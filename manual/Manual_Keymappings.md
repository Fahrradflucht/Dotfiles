# Manual Keymappings

## Keyboard Layout
On a german Mac keyboard use [GermanDev](https://github.com/arminbw/GermanDev) as keyboard layout to map the following:

`⌥` + `d` = `[`

`⌥` + `f` = `[`

`⌥` + `j` = `{`

`⌥` + `k` = `}`

## Seil
Use *Seil* to map `CapsLock` to `Esc`

Set `CapsLock` to *No Action* in System Preferences for **every** keyboard to stop `CapsLock` delay.
